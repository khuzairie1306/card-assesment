**Section B - Mysql Improvement**


Time to Complete = 30 minutes;

Suggestion Improvement

1.You can Use Database indexes in MySQL enable you to accelerate the performance of SELECT query statements.  
2.You can also use pagination by using the LIMIT and OFFSET/FETCH clauses (i can see the below mysql query you already use).<br>
3.You also can use Temp table but with proper indexes.<br>
4. Caching - DECLARE use_cache BOOL DEFAULT true;<br>
5. You can install load balance for communicate one or more MySQL servers and provides connectivity to those servers for multiple clients.<br>
6. If you have proper indexes not worries about Like statement but recommend try to use equal statement if Like statement not necessary  .<br>
